This script deploys the default static analysis model from Azure Cognitive Services Vision API. This model works with the semisupervised framework to marshal the vision API and return the JSON results of the analysis.  The module can be configured to perform any of the vision analysis services by setting the appropriate environment variable.

Start by signing up for a free cognitive services account https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/try/cognitive-services/ if you do not already have one.

Next, upload both of the powershell scripts from the imageAnalysisModel and the semisupervisedFramework, .ps1 files you will find in the solutions directories, to Azure to your azure subscription.  This article
shows how to upload and run powershell scripts in Azure:
https://www.ntweekly.com/2019/05/24/upload-and-run-powershell-script-from-azure-cloud-shell/

You can test the sample function using a public image simply pass in 'test' as your file name to be analyzed and the model will analyze an image from wikipedia, the URL will look something like this: https://{the name of your function app}.azurewebsites.net/{the name of your function}/?name=test or
https://branddetectionapp.azurewebsites.net/api/detectbrand/?name=test

If you want to perform custom model development in Python, you will need to complete the following steps to prepare your python development environment:

Set up your VS Code python environment.
Start by reading this document: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-function-python then this document: http://www.roelpeters.be/using-python-in-azure-functions/

Then install required software:

- install VS Code from here: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
- install Python from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ 
    note as of this writing, 7/15/19, azure functions only supports python 3.6.x so make sure and pick that version and if your OS is 64 bit pick the 64 bit version or it can create path issues.
- install node.js from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- install the Docker client from here: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

Start VS Code and open a terminal.  From there run the following commands:
- "npm install -g azure-functions-core-tools" to install azure functions core tools into VS Code.  This enables you to work with azure functions from within VS Code directly enabling things like deploy.

- "pip install requests" to install http handling into VS Code.  This will allow you to work with HTTP requests which is the protocol used to communicate between the framework and the model.

- Decide which type of model you want to install Static or Trained: install Azure Computer Vision: 
    "pip install azure-cognitiveservices-vision-customvision" for custom 
or 
    "pip install azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision" for static

    This will enable you to call the approprate vision services from your modeling

Then click on the extension icon on the far left in VS Code and add these VS Code extensions:
- Python
- Azure Account
- Azure Functions

Now log into Azure from VS Code: https://www.ntweekly.com/2018/01/10/connect-microsoft-azure-directly-visual-studio-code/

Finally, enter this command in the command prompt to deploy your python code to the server:

func azure functionapp publish {name of your app} --build-native-deps
for example
func azure functionapp publish brandDetectionApp --build-native-deps

note: the reason you cannot use the VS code deploy command is your python dependencies load on the server
will fail as a large number of imports do not have a required public registry specifying how to fetch the
import.

Now you are ready to start coding.  Start by running this Python Azure Function quick start.  It will provide a very simple function that takes in a name parameter and returns a hello response.  You will then be able to add your code to this function and start deploying and running it.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/quickstarts/python-analyze

The short sample which calls the static Azure Vision Services image analysis web service uses the vanilla
code generated by the quick start and adds the ability to call the vision API via http, updates the analysis JSON with the average confidence for the target brand, 'Microsoft' as a root key and puts the updated JSON response from the analysis service into the function response for processing by the semisupervised framework.

Once you have the quick start code running you will need to add these imports to the top of your python code in addition to the lines quick start added to your code:
- import os
- import json
- import requests
- from azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision import ComputerVisionClient
- from azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.models import VisualFeatureTypes
- from msrest.authentication import CognitiveServicesCredentials
- from io import BytesIO

Note: If you are using a Jupyter notebook, include the following lines.
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image

Finally, if you want to debug locally you will need to read tsi article about how to set up local debugging.  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local

Long running fucntions ********* need to see if there is a response time limitation on functions and advise how to handle this in the model python.************
